# LinkedList Exercise 

	The following program is able to read a **txt file** which contains around alphabetically disoredered 99999 words. The programs must be able, to read line by line the txt file, then whenever a new line is read, save it directly to a LinkedList in its correspondant position (depending on where is situaded alphabetically compared with the existant words).
	
	After, every single word is ordered and stored in the LinkedList, we fill a new txt file with this LinkedList under the name "sorteddict.txt". **Nevertheless, the first program took too much time to compile the entire txt file. In order to do that we have implemented several methods.** 
	
	After the creation of this new file, the program display a menu to the user. Like the following:
		*1. Enter a string or an input. [User enters string -> program returns position. Returns -1 in case of non-														exissten word]
						[User enters input -> program returns word of that position]
		*2. Help.
		*3. Exit
	
	On the other hand, we have worked on developing a TEST option. All the info regarded with this option is available at the readme file of its regarding branch. 

*Because of the lenght of this program, we have added several short txt files**
