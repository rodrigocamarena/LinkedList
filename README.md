# LinkedList Exercise with Amaury

The following program is able to read a **txt file** which contains 
around 99999 words. Then, the program order alphabetically the words and 
save them in a new **file txt** whose name is _sorteddict.txt_.

After the creation of this new file, the program display a menu to the user. Like the following:

* 1. Insert y in order to look for a word in the document or the index of a word.
* 2. Inser n in order to exit the program. 

	The user, can insert an index or a word 10 times. After that, 
the program will end automatically.

** Because of the length of the txt file, we have added a second _unsorteddict.txt_ file that is a shorter vesion of the original one in order to 
comprobate fastly the program works properly.
