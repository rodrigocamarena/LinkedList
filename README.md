# LinkedList Exercise with Amaury

The following program is able to read a **txt file** which contains 
around 99999 words. Then, the program order alphabetically the words and 
save them in a new **file txt** whose name is _sorteddict.txt_.

After the creation of this new file, the program display a menu to the user. Like the following:
	*Which ask the user, to enter a String or a input. If it is a String, the program will retrun the position of that
	word at the txt file. IF the word does not exists in the txt file, the program will return a -1. If the user enters
	an integer, the programs returns the word associated to that integer. 
	
The user will also find a TEST MENU:
	*Everything is explained at the readme file in the TEST branch. 
	

** Because of the length of the txt file, we have added a second _unsorteddict.txt_ file that is a shorter vesion of the original one in order to comprobate fastly the program works properly. **
